I'm a PhD student in <a href='https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/'>Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/'>Prof. Vikas Singh</a>. I am interested in problems that are theoritically motivated and have applications in practice. Currently, I am working on Efficient Deep Learning. Please find a list of my publications <a href='/publications/'>here</a>.

Previously, undergrad from <a href='https://www.iitm.ac.in/'>IIT-Madras</a>.

(If you are interested in Efficiency in Deep Learning, let's talk!)
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
